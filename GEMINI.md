# Project Overview

This project is a simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game. The entire game is implemented in a single HTML file (`tictactoe.html`) which includes the HTML structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.

## Key Features:

*   **Player vs Player (PvP) and Player vs AI (PvAI) modes:** Users can choose to play against another person or against a simple AI.
*   **Statistics Tracking:** The game keeps track of wins for Player X, Player O, and ties. These statistics can be reset.
*   **Dark Mode:** A theme toggle allows users to switch between a light and dark theme.
*   **Responsive Design:** The game has a clean and responsive layout that should work on different screen sizes.

# Building and Running

This is a static web project with no build process. To run the game, simply open the `tictactoe.html` file in a web browser.

# Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:** The code is written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript code is organized into a `TicTacToe` class.
*   **File Structure:** All the code is in a single `tictactoe.html` file. The `index.html` file is currently empty and the `README.md` contains a simple title.
